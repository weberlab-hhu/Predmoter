# Visualization
Visualization methods of Predmoter's results, i.e. test metrics and predictions, as
well as visualization methods of downstream analysis of Predmoter's predictions
like called peaks can be found in the Notebooks present in this folder.
Furthermore, Predmoter's predictions can be visualized using
[Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://igv.org), available as a Desktop App or
online. Necessary are: the predictions in bigWig format, the indexed fasta file
([samtools faidx](https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-faidx.html)) and optionally
an annotation file (gff format).
